## Usage
Drag and drop your images into the empty space, you will preview three images, except if you only drag one or two. Below you can see the total amount of images to convert (subtracting three from preview). If you cannot drag, click on `Add images`.

Leave the first switch on if you want to save them in the same folder, if you prefer to choose a specific folder, turn it off. You can also generate a tiny icon by turning on the second switch. Finally, click on `Convert` button, a loading circle will appear and as soon as everything is cleaned on the interface, you will have your icons created.

If you need to delete the images you have added by mistake, click on the arrows icon. Remember that you can drag images as many times as you want even before clicking the `Convert` button.

You can disable or enable the **TopMost** option (Drop Icons on top of all windows) from the context menu, by right clicking anywhere and `Enable TopMost` or `Disable TopMost`.

To change the language you must click on the top Info button, a new window will appear. In the lower section that says **Drop Icons Language** click on the little arrows icon to switch between Español or English, then click on the back button and it will restart with the language you have chosen.
